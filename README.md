### 👩‍💻 About Me  
Hello! I'm **Kate — a self-taught Data Analyst**, Python enthusiast, and someone who is genuinely in love with data and the stories it can tell.

I believe data is not just numbers —  
it reveals behavior, intention, and opportunity.

This repository is part of my learning journey and growing portfolio.
