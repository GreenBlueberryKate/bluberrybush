### 👩‍💻 About Me  

Bluberrybush is a growing data-analysis portfolio focused on exploratory data analysis, machine-learning experiments, and storytelling with real-world datasets.

This project reflects my journey as a self-taught data analyst — learning by building, experimenting, and transforming raw data into meaningful insights.

✨ About the Project

I believe data is more than numbers —
it reveals behavior, intention, and opportunity.

Bluberrybush is a collection of practical notebooks where I explore:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

🤖 Machine Learning experiments

📈 Regression models & predictions

💼 Business insight case studies

🐍 Python-based data workflows

Each project represents a step forward in my growth as a data storyteller.
