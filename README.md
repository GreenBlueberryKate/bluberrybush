🌿 bluberrybush

Bluberrybush is my growing data-analysis portfolio — a collection of exploratory data analysis projects, machine-learning experiments, and Python notebooks built around real-world datasets.
This repository documents my journey as a self-taught data analyst, learning by building practical projects and turning raw data into meaningful insights.

✨ About
I created bluberrybush as a space to experiment, improve, and share my progress in data analytics. Each notebook represents hands-on learning focused on:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📈 Regression & predictive modeling

🤖 Machine-learning experimentation

💼 Business insights & storytelling with data

The goal is not perfection — but continuous growth and real practice.
